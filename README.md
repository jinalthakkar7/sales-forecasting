# Sales Forecasting ML Project

This repository contains all the code and data for a machine learning project focused on forecasting sales. The project uses historical sales data to train a predictive model, which is then visualized in Tableau.

## Overview

The Sales Forecasting ML Project aims to develop predictive models that can accurately forecast future sales based on historical data. This involves exploring various factors that impact sales, such as seasonal trends, promotions, and economic conditions. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to uncover patterns and insights from past sales data, which are then used to make informed predictions about future sales. The end result is visualized using Tableau, providing an intuitive and interactive way for stakeholders to understand and explore the forecasting results.
